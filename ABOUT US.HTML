       <h1>About us</h1>
       <p>Vaccinations are the best way to protect yourself and others from infectious diseases. They also make a significant contribution to the containment of pandemics. Since December 2020, Berliners can be vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The vaccinations are free of charge for citizens, regardless of their health insurance status. There is no obligation to be vaccinated – vaccination against the coronavirus is voluntary.
        With the development and approval of various vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, numerous misleading and false claims about vaccination have been circulated. The fact check of the federal government provides information and clarifies the situation.
        
        Before vaccination: eligibility, appointment booking, documents
        In order to contain the pandemic in a targeted manner and to protect persons with a particularly high risk of a severe course of the disease, it is necessary to prioritize the persons entitled to receive the vaccination. The coronavirus vaccination ordinance of the Federal Ministry of Health regulates on a priority basis which groups of people can be vaccinated. The ordinance defines three groups of people who are entitled to receive the vaccination first: highest priority, high priority and increased priority. The highest priority group includes people over 80 years of age and people who work in medical facilities who have an increased risk of exposure. The high priority group includes people over 70 years of age, employees in elementary schools or child care facilities, and people with certain preexisting conditions. The third group of people who have increased priority includes people over 60 years of age and people working in certain system-relevant occupations. Pregnant women and people with pre-existing conditions should first consult their doctor.
        
        The priorities stated in the corona vaccination ordinance are based on the vaccination recommendation of the Standing Vaccination Commission at the Robert Koch Institute, which is continuously reviewed and adjusted if necessary.
        
        Invitation and booking an appointment
        Those eligible for vaccination receive a personal invitation letter including a vaccination code from the Senate Department for Health, Care and Equality. This allows them to make an appointment to be vaccinated at one of Berlin’s vaccination centers. The invitation letter is accompanied by a medical history form and a consent form. The invitations are personal: Appointments cannot be given to third parties and must be rescheduled in case of illness.
        Further information and services concerning the corona (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination are provided on the Berlin service portal.
        
        Documents required for vaccination
        The following documents must be brought to the vaccination:
        • Identity card, passport or residence permit
        • Personal invitation letter
        • Completed medical history form
        • Signed consent form
        You do not have to bring a vaccination certificate. For organizational reasons, vaccinated persons receive a separate vaccination record card, which your doctor can add to the vaccination certificate later.
        
        Procedure of the vaccination in the vaccination centers
        No rapid test for coronavirus is performed at the vaccination center. However, your body temperature may be measured. Persons with a raised temperature are not allowed to enter the vaccination center and must make a new appointment. Accompanying persons must always wait outside the building.
        Vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus consists of two vaccinations. Depending on the vaccine, the second vaccination is given after three to twelve weeks. Both appointments are already scheduled when the appointment is made. One vaccination appointment lasts 1 to 1.5 hours.
        
        Before the actual vaccination, a consultation takes place in which you are given information on possible side effects, instructions about the procedure and recommendations on what you should do after the vaccination. A brief, symptom-based examination to rule out acute illnesses and allergies is also performed. The vaccine is then administered intramuscularly – usually by injection into the upper arm.
        
        Before vaccinated persons are allowed to return home, there is a 30-minute follow-up period which must be observed. A separate room with seating is available for this purpose.
        
        After vaccination: compliance with the Corona measures
        The general coronavirus containment measures continue to apply to vaccinated persons. All rules – such as the wearing of a mask – and restrictions – such as the quarantine obligation when entering the country from abroad – still apply to vaccinated persons.
        
        Vaccinations by mobile vaccination teams
        People who cannot visit a vaccination center due to their limited mobility are visited by mobile vaccination teams. This includes, among others, persons in need of care in assisted living communities, in senior citizen facilities and nursing homes.</p>
