                    <p><font size="4">
                    Fond memories. Major milestones. And more.
                    Moments from the past that are fueling the future
                    Our story began in 1870 when John D. Rockefeller and his 
                    associates formed the Standard Oil Company (Ohio). In 1911, 
                    the U.S. Supreme Court divided Standard Oil into 33 different
                    companies, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (Jersey Standard), 
                    Socony Oil, Vacuum Oil and some companies that retained the name Standard
                    Oil.
                    
                    In many states, Jersey Standard marketed its products under the brand 
                    ‘Esso’, which is the phonetic pronunciation of the initials ‘S’ and ‘O’ 
                    in Standard Oil. However in other states, the other Standard Oil companies 
                    objected. In those states, Jersey Standard marketed under the brands
                    Enco (Energy Company) and Humble (an oil company they acquired).
                     Jersey Standard became zen gas Corporation in 1972 and in 1999 
                     joined with Mobil Oil Corporation, formerly Socony-Vacuum Oil, 
                     to form Exxon Mobil Corporation.Gargoyles, winged horses and tigers
                    As we’ve made changes, mergers, and more, so too have our trademarks, 
                    icons and advertising campaigns evolved. Here are a few particularly
                     memorable examples.
