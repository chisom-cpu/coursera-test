         <h1 align="center">Covid Vaccine Tracker</h1>
         <p><center>The worldwide endeavor to create a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is bearing fruit. Almost 20 vaccines now have been authorized around the globe; many more remain in development.
 
            To clarify the landscape for our readers, our vaccine tracker has been split in two. The first chart details vaccines that have achieved regulatory authorization or approval; the second continues to follow candidates in Phase 1-3 clinical trials and some promising candidates in early development. To reveal in-depth information about each candidate, select the “Details” button above the chart or click on the green plus button next to each entry.
             
            Information about the unprecedented public/private partnerships spawned by the COVID-19 public health emergency now can be found below the charts.
             
            Our charts will be updated weekly. If you wish to submit an update or notice an issue with this data, please email Focus at news@raps.org. 
             
            Updated 17 June to include new information on vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Research Institute, Janssen Vaccines, Sinovac, and CanSino Biologics, as well as newly authorized or approved vaccines from Shifa Pharmed Industrial Group and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/Institute of Medical Biology. Information has been updated for vaccine candidates from Curevac, Novavax and Nanocovax; a new candidate from the University of Hong Kong has been added.

            1 If you have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) or an immediate allergic reaction to any ingredient in the vaccine you are scheduled to receive, you should not get that vaccine. If you have been instructed not to get one type of COVID-19 vaccine, you may still be able to get another type. Learn more information for people with allergies.
            
            2 You should get your second shot as close to the recommended 3-week or 4-week interval as possible. However, your second shot may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, if necessary.

         <h2 align="center">COVID-19 vaccine initiatives</h2>
         <p><center> OWS: Operation Warp Speed is a collaboration of several US government departments including Health and Human Services (HHS) and subagencies, Defense, Agriculture, Energy and Veterans Affairs and the private sector. OWS has funded JNJ-78436735 (Janssen), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and NVX‑CoV2373 (Novavax), V590 (Merck/IAVI), V591 (Merck/Themis), AZD1222 (AstraZeneca/University of Oxford), and the candidate developed by Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline.
             
            OWS is “part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.” Leaders of OWS say they could vaccinate as many as 20 million people by the end of the year and 100 million people by February.  
             
            ACTIV: Within OWS, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has partnered with more than 18 biopharmaceutical companies in an initiative called ACTIV. ACTIV aims to fast-track development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19.
